  <p>
    I teach to entrepreneurs who have had zero programming education how to build
    a web application using Ruby on Rails. This program is our <strong>fullstack web development bootcamp</strong>,
    by <a href="http://www.lewagon.org/en">Le Wagon</a>. We also have a
    web platform where you can learn programming,
    <a href="https://ondemand.lewagon.org">Le Wagon On Demand</a>.

  <p>
    Every wednesday night in Paris, we do a free <a href="http://workshops.lewagon.org">workshop</a>, you might want to register to the
    <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Le-Wagon-Paris-Coding-Station">Meetup</a>!
    I usually do the "Start with Git & GitHub" one. See you!
