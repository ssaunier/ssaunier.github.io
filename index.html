      Hello,
      <small><em>vous parlez <a href="/fr/" rel="alternate" hreflang="fr">français</a> ?</em></small>

  </h1>

  <p>
    I am <a href="/"><span itemprop="name">Sébastien Saunier</span></a>, a <strong itemprop="role">Web Software Engineer</strong> from <span itemprop="location">Paris</span> focused on
    (<a href="http://www.laurencegellert.com/2012/08/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/">full-stack</a>)
    <strong>web development</strong>. I have been building stuff for the web since 2001.
    I have a fairly good experience of startups and enjoy building new
    products using a nice combination of <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean</a>,
    Agile and development best practices. I do also enjoy having a say about the engineering team workflow and tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am now a <a href="http://freelancebooking.pro/en/users/ssaunier">freelance engineer</a> and I will be happy to help you bootstrapping your product as fast as possible, smartly. In fact, I want you not to waste any money, and to <strong>learn</strong> as much as possible from every euro you spend. That should set you on the right track for success!
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated in 2008 from <a href="http://www.polytechnique.edu/jsp/accueil.jsp?LANGUE=1">Polytechnique</a> and joined <a href="https://www.google.com/about/jobs/locations/zurich/">Google</a> as an software engineer intern. I came back to Paris in 2009 and worked 3 years for <a href="http://www.virtuoz.com">VirtuOz</a> on the SaaS tool suite. In 2012, I joined <a href="http://www.applidget.com">Applidget</a>
    as the lead developer of <a href="http://www.mobicheckin.com">MobiCheckin</a>, an award-winning SaaS solution for professional event organizer. Since 2007, I have helped <a href="http://www.sogedis.fr">Sogedis</a> bootstrap and grow their ecommerce from zero to a monthly revenue of 250k€.
